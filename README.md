MyFirstGame
===========

This is a game that I am creating to practice using Python.

I am learing about software divelopment so that I can enter a job market that will value my analytical skills.  I have a MS in Mathematics from Portland State University and I am working as an adjunct mathematics Instructor.

I will not be making changes to this game for a while.  I have accomplished some things, but I am disappointed that I have not accomplished others.  In my judgement the following aspects are successful:

 - The player's inventory works the way it is supposed to, 
 - equipping and unequipping items modifies combat the way it's supposed to, 
 - there is a special item that works the way it is supposed to, 
 - combat order is decided without errors,
 - creatures die when it is appropriate,
 - combat ends when it is supposed to, and
 - moving from one room to another works properly.

The following aspects I will change if I come back to this project:
 - I will include items that permanently modify the player's stats or add spells,
 - I will create creatures that can take actions besides attack,
 - I will add more interesting flavor text and a plot, and
 - I will balance the game so that the player will be forced to use different actions at different times in order to survive.
